                        <h2>Who is Maira?</h2>
                        <a>Hello there, my name is Maira,
                            I was born in Mexico City and raised in San Francisco California

                            since I was 10 years old. I graduated from George Washington High School in 2014 and
                            continued my education
                            at San Francisco State University to pursue a career in Pshychology and a minor in Latino
                            Studies. Although I liked the career path I was taking I found myself not being too happy
                            and
                            decided to explore other majors. Computer Science had always been interesting to me because
                            I watched my dad fix his own computers when I was a kid, he introduced me to all the video
                            games I know and taught me my first keyboard shortcuts.
                            After taking Intro to Computer Science at State they literally had me at "Hello World", at
                            this moment I knew I wanted to be able to bring my ideas to life!
                            I knew that if I got into coding I could make that happen. I decided to give my career a
                            change and decided to dive into UC Berkeley's full time coding bootcamp
                            to become a full stack web developer, and master in both the back end and the front end of
                            web development.</a>
